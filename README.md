# remove sm following

This tool connects to Instagram with your saved session. It loads your session settings, Validates the session, Fetches your followers and following lists,check which accounts you follow that don't follow you back, filter out private accounts, then show what would be unfollowed (without actually unfollowing in dry-run mode).

The script will display output showing accounts that would be unfollowed. Since it's making network requests to Instagram, it may take a minute or two to complete. Once it finishes, you'll see a summary message.
